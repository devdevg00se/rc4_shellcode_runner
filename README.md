# Shellcode Runner in C with RC4 Encryption

Example illustrating how to use basic encryption to obfuscate a payload in order to evade AV.
Two C programs: One encrypts shellcode via RC4; The other decrypts the RC4-encrypted shellcode at runtime and executes it.

## How to use
1. Add your unencrypted shellcode to source file encrypt_shellcode.c and modify rc4 password if desired. If you change password, make sure you update it in encrypt_shellcode.c and execute_encrypted_shellcode.c
2. Build source file with `gcc -s encrypt_shellcode.c -o encrypt_shellcode.exe` and run `encrypt_shellcode.exe`
3. Copy output from encrypt_shellcode.exe and copy into source file `execute_encrypted_shellcode.c` 
4. Build source file with `gcc -s execute_encrypted_shellcode.c -o execute_encrypted_shellcode.exe`
5. Running `execute_encrypted_shellcode.exe` will decrypt and then execute the shellcode
